I am a postdoc in the [Burge Lab](https://www.genes.mit.edu/) at MIT. I am currently working on a few projects, including upgrading a 'white box' machine learning model for RNA splicing prediction, analyzing how alternative splicing features impact splicing predictions, and the impact on gene expression regulation by 3'UTR variants. Due to the shortage of funding, I am looking for my next position. 

I received my PhD in computational biology from University of Maryland, College Park (2024) where I was a student in the NCI-UMD partnership, coadvised by [Dr. Steve Mount](https://biology.umd.edu/people/steve-mount) and [Dr. Dan Larson](https://ccr.cancer.gov/staff-directory/daniel-r-larson). I developed a method to investigate features of RNA sequences using mixture models, which helped me to characterize the sequences of different open reading frames, and potential intron subtypes. Then I applied this method to analyze features of recursive splicing, a special splicing mechanism where a large intron is removed by the spliceosome in multiple segments.
Before moving to Maryland, I was a bioinformatician at [Burning Rock Dx, Shanghai](https://us.brbiotech.com/) for 3 years, where I developed bioinformatics tools for DNA-Seq analysis after obtaining my Master's degree at Georgetown University, where I worked with [Dr. Nathan Edwards](https://edwardslab.bmcb.georgetown.edu/) on interpreting Mass Spectrometry data.

I enjoy tackling biological questions through inspired and innovative coding. I have experience in both developing bioinformatics tools and interpreting challenging biological big data. I am excited about learning new frameworks/languages and coding strategies. Besides computational biology, I like video games, hiking, and reading.
